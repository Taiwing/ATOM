Packaging:
	*choose a licence for the program
	*test packaging on other systems/CPUs

Functionalities:
	*add a date format to the tag system
	*clean the output format and create an option to sort output in different ways
	*maybe add a concept of "virtual tags" wich would be based on already existing
	metadata, either specific to the file format (mp3 or avi for example), or more
	generally on things like access rights, creation and modification dates, size,
	owner, file format, etc... virtual tags couldn't be directly be modified by tag,
	but they could be turned to the dark si... I mean they could be turned into real
	tags, which could be used and modified by the tag program and maybe updated when
	the vitual tag is modified (which would mean create a type of tag linked to the
	original data)
	*create a system to differentiate between different types of tags, for example,
	every tag could maybe begin with a tag type byte (normal, linked), and with a
	tag format byte (string, number, date) (the format byte seems more useful than
	the type byte for now...)
	*add a save and restore function for the tags
	*add support for symbolic links
	*code a file explorer on top of tag (tagex)
		*maybe in tagex:
		*add functions to automatically create tags based 
		on the file path (meaning, the name of the folders it's in)
		either in a relative or absolute fashion
		with options to delete all or some of the folders once it is done
		*and also do the reverse operation, create folders based on all or
		certain tags, in a "biggest tag first" way (the folders are created
		in descending order, the first one represent the least rare tags),
		or in a certain specified way, or order 
	*and a GUI version of tagex (possibly using GTK)

Misc:
	*write a man page for the program
