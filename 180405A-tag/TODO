Packaging:
	*choose a licence for the program
	*test packaging on other systems/CPUs

Functionalities:
	*maybe think about adding other formats, like URLs or links to files,
	which could be very useful in a tag explorer
	*create a fixed-width float numbers library
	*add a float format (or replace W_TAG_INT by a W_TAG_NB), if adding is chosen
	make it possible to compare tag integers and tag floats as if they were the same
	*extend the number format to authorize things like exponents and stuff
	*maybe add a concept of "virtual tags" wich would be based on already existing
	metadata, either specific to the file format (mp3 or avi for example), or more
	generally on things like access rights, creation and modification dates, size,
	owner, file format, etc... virtual tags couldn't be directly be modified by tag,
	but they could be turned to the dark si... I mean they could be turned into real
	tags, which could be used and modified by the tag program and maybe updated when
	the vitual tag is modified (which would mean create a type of tag linked to the
	original data)
	*add a save and restore function for the tags
	*add support for symbolic links
	*code a file explorer on top of tag (tagex)
		*add functions to automatically create tags based 
		on the file path (meaning, the name of the folders it's in)
		either in a relative or absolute fashion
		with options to delete all or some of the folders once it is done
		*and also do the reverse operation, create folders based on all or
		certain tags, in a "biggest tag first" way (the folders are created
		in descending order, the first one represent the least rare tags),
		or in a certain specified way, or order
	*also, once again on top of that, maybe create a autotag utility, which
	could be setup to automatically tag files based on certain cues and events
	in the system, or could prompt the user to enter certain tag values
	*and a GUI version of tagex (possibly using GTK)

multi-plaform support:
	*make the writing functions endian agnostic

misc:
	*update the manual with the format concep (date in particular)
