- watch for incongruencies in the get_conv functions with wrong casts
- find out how printf handles its errors (for now I am under the impression
  that it stops at the first non-valid character and that it prints the rest
  of the string from this character included and with a '%' symbol before it)
- make it pass the tests (42FileChecker among other)
- add bonuses like the ' flag and "aAeEfFgG" conversions, and custom ones like "b"
