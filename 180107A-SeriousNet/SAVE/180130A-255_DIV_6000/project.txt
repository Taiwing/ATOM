GOAL:
  -generate neural networks from user input
  -train them from data

LIMITS:
  -networks sizes is between 3 and 100000 layers and between 1 and 10000 neurons
   in width (for now)

METHOD:
  -create a conf system for the networks: Each net will be identified by a name
   string unique to them. The configuration will be saved in a .nn file named
   after the network (eg. name.nn). It will store the number of layers, their
   width, the biases corresponding to each layer after the input one, and all the
   weights of the network.
  -if a new net is created (if the name given by the user doesn't correspond to
   an existing .nn file), then it will be generated by the parameters given by
   the users's command. If the number of layers and/or the sizes of the layers
   are not precised, it will result in an error. Otherwise, a .nn file will be
   created with the values indicated by the user, and the weights and biases
   values will be randomly assigned if not precised.

TODO:
  -add other available options and make param.c great again (or great preiod)
  -make every non-weights/biases parameters unprecised be automatically filled
   by the global default configuration file
